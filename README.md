## Front-End.us   : 0.1.3
##### [https://front-end.us/](https://front-end.us)

##### Front-End.us is a repository that I use to bootstrap my projects.  It is built with the following technologies:

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Vue3](https://v3.vuejs.org/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [HeadlessUI](https://headlessui.dev/)

I found myself building the same frontend components over and over again. So I decided to build a set of frontend Views and components that I can use to bootstrap my projects more efficinently.  I decided to open source it so that others can benefit from it as well.  I hope you enjoy it.

I will be adding more components as I build them. In addition to the landing, faq, login, and register pages I usually need an admin section so I think that will be next. If you have any suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
