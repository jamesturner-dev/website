      If your website takes too long to load and has sluggish performance most people won't
      stick around to see your content.

      That is why, imho, website speed is fundamental.
      What good is a great looking website if almost nobody waits for it to load?

      Even in the age of super fast broadband and 5G, loading a very heavy site on a mobile
      device can be excruciating. I have worked with agencies that create beautiful
      WordPress websites that take 30 seconds to load. That might not sound like a long
      time but slowly count to 30.

      I'm have often been hired to fix these kinds of sites. However without some serious
      compromises the best I can often do is tinker around the edges. To build a site that
      is very robust you have to take a holistic approach. Even still, I can often speed up
      these behemoths by using next gen image formats, deferring JavaScript, removing
      unnecessary CSS, etc.

      But the real magic happens when all of the pieces ( hosting,
      front-end, back-end, database, etc. ) work together.
      It starts with choosing the hosting for your site. Some people try to save money by
      hosting their site on bargain hosting providers like Hostgator but this is never a
      good idea. You cannot build fast websites on a slow, shared, server.

      The next mistake people make is choosing a CMS like WordPress and loading it with plugins
      and page-makers. It's is possible to build a fast WordPress site but they are few and far
      between in the real world. Most people that use WordPress pick a heavy theme, use a page
      builder like Elementor, and load up on plugins. Each layer adds to the sites footprint and
      makes it slower. Add that to having to make database calls for each page view to a shared
      MySQL server and it's easy to see why WP sites are generally so slow.

      Hosting a modern framework on a scale-able cloud service provides a night and day comparison
      in terms of speed.

    <p>
      I have built sites with WordPress that load in under 1 second but they are few and far
      between. I have built sites with Vue.js and Nuxt.js that load in under 100ms. That is
      the difference between a fast website and a slow website.
